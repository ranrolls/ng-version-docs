Templates

In Angular, templates are written with HTML that contains Angular-specific elements and attributes. Angular combines the template with information from the model and controller to render the dynamic view that a user sees in the browser.

These are the types of Angular elements and attributes you can use:

    Directive — An attribute or element that augments an existing DOM element or represents a reusable DOM component.
    Markup — The double curly brace notation {{ }} to bind expressions to elements is built-in Angular markup.
    Filter — Formats data for display.
    Form controls — Validates user input.
